### Introduction
In the past databases didn't exist and they used flat-file and spreed sheets to store data
but this is not efficient and there are more data redunduncy and leak of data concurrency.
So they came up with the concept of database and RDBMS to reduce data redunduncy and make it easier to manipulate data so they came up with SQL(structure query language) to facilitate maniputalting data to creat, read, update and delete (CRUD).


### SQL Data types

    1. NUMBER(number of digits).

    1. VARCHAR2(number of characters) -> free unused allocated memory.
